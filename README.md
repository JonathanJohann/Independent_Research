# Independent_Research

## Introduction
Since the end of highschool, I've appreciated the practice of autodidacticism. Thus, I have finally decided to start my own repository of independent research projects to practice both implementation and theory. Hopefully, if you've stumbled upon my repository by accident or have come from LinkedIn, you find this page to be insightful in some way!

## 6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects: IAP 2015

Although 6.S085 does not appear as if it will be offered this IAP for the winter of 2017, I feel strongly that these slides are very important for a researcher to know. As a result, I've decided to replicate many of the concepts in Jupyter Notebooks.

## A Collection of Data Science Take Home Challenges

I personally love this guide to data science take home challenges. Often times, as aspiring data scientists, we're told to look at Kaggle and, as much I like Kaggle, I like how these Data Science challenges are short activities where you can wrap up your analysis faster. If you're a budding data scientist without a knack for sklearn and pandas, I'd definitely recommend starting with this!
