  "body": "# Jonathan's Independent Research\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nSince the end of highschool, I've appreciated the practice of autodidacticism. Thus, I have finally decided to start my own repository of independent research projects to practice both implementation and theory. Hopefully, if you've stumbled upon my repository by accident or have come from LinkedIn, you find this page to be insightful in some way!\r\n\r\n## 6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects: IAP 2015\r\nReference Website: http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/\r\n\r\nAlthough 6.S085 does not appear as if it will be offered this IAP for the winter of 2017, I feel strongly that these slides are very important for a researcher to know. As a result, I've decided to replicate many of the concepts in Jupyter Notebooks.\r\n\r\n#### 6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects Problem Set 1.ipynb\r\n* Data Visualization via boxplots, histograms, kde/density plots.\r\n* Use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic.\r\n\r\n#### 6.S085 Statistics for Research Projects Problem Set 2.ipynb (in progress)\r\n\r\n## A Collection of Data Science Take Home Challenges\r\nReference Website: http://datascientistjobinterview.com/\r\n\r\nI personally love this guide to data science take home challenges. Often times, as aspiring data scientists, we're told to look at Kaggle and, as much I like Kaggle, I like how these Data Science challenges are short activities where you can wrap up your analysis faster. If you're a starting data scientist without a knack for sklearn and pandas, I'd definitely recommend starting with this!\r\n\r\n#### Spanish AB Test.ipynb (in progress)\r\n* Determining Feature Importances using a Decision Tree Classifier via sklearn.\r\n\r\n## Kaggle\r\nReference Website: https://www.kaggle.com/\r\n\r\nAfter getting my hands dirty with reading \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R\" (Slowly making my way through \"Elements of Statistical Learning\" when I have the time) and practicing with \"A Collection of Data Science Take Home Challenges\", this is a great next step and an incredibly well known site by data scientists. During periods when I have more time to take on some of the interesting projects on Kaggle, I'll post the stuff that I work on!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details for contacting me:\r\nLinkedIn Profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-f-johannemann-5aa85894\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or if you find that something is in fact incorrect, please feel free to reach out to me at jonjoh@mit.edu!\r\n",
